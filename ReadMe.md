# Group Capstone(was done alone)

This is the first time at Microverse that we will build a project in a group. Apart from technical knowledge, we will need to use a few new processes and tools. We have been preparing for that with a few individual tasks in the Microverse program, and it is a time to connect all of them together. Besides - it's time to check what exactly we will build!

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- WebPack and Gitflow.

## Getting Started

The JavaScript capstone project is about building our own web application based on an external API. You have select an API [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/): data about the Pok√©mon world that provides data to build the webapp around it. The webapp have 3 user interfaces.
